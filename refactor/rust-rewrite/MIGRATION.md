## Component Mapping

### Go Package â†’ Rust Crate Mapping

| Go Package | Rust Crate | Status | Notes |
|------------|------------|--------|-------|
| `pkg/inngest` | `inngest-core` | âœ… Done | Core types and traits |
| `pkg/execution/queue` | `inngest-queue` | ðŸš§ In Progress | Queue abstractions complete, implementations needed |
| `pkg/execution/executor` | `inngest-executor` | ðŸš§ In Progress | Basic structure done, HTTP execution needed |
| `pkg/execution/state` | `inngest-state` | ðŸš§ In Progress | Memory implementation done, PostgreSQL needed |
| `cmd/commands` | `inngest-cli` | âœ… Done | Basic CLI structure complete |
| `pkg/devserver` | `inngest-devserver` | ðŸš§ In Progress | Basic server done, function discovery needed |
| `pkg/api` | `inngest-api` | ðŸ“‹ Planned | GraphQL and REST APIs |
| `pkg/config` | `inngest-config` | âœ… Done | Basic configuration management |

### Key Go Types â†’ Rust Types

| Go Type | Rust Type | Location |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| `inngest.Function` | `Function` | `inngest-core::function` |
| `event.Event` | `Event` | `inngest-core::event` |
| `state.State` | `RunState` | `inngest-state` |
| `queue.Item` | `QueueItem` | `inngest-queue` |
| `execution.Executor` | `Executor` trait | `inngest-executor` |

## API Compatibility

### HTTP Endpoints

All existing HTTP endpoints will be maintained:

- `POST /e/{event_key}` - Event ingestion
- `GET /api/v1/functions` - List functions
- `GET /api/v1/runs` - List function runs
- GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql`

### SDK Compatibility

The Rust implementation maintains complete compatibility with existing SDKs:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript SDK**: No changes required
- **Python SDK**: No changes required  
- **Go SDK**: No changes required
- **Kotlin/Java SDK**: No changes required

### Event Format

Event format remains unchanged:

```json
{
  "name": "user.created",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "123",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "123"
  },
  "ts": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Function Definition Format

Function configurations remain compatible:

```json
{
  "id": "process-user",
  "name": "Process User",
  "triggers": [
    {
      "event": "user.created"
    }
  ],
  "concurrency": {
    "limit": 5,
    "key": "event.data.user_id"
  }
}
```

## Performance Goals

### Memory Usage
- **Target**: 50% reduction in memory usage
- **Strategy**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and efficient memory management
- **Measurement**: RSS memory usage under load

### Throughput
- **Target**: 2x improvement in request throughput
- **Strategy**: Async/await with tokio, efficient serialization
- **Measurement**: Requests per second in load tests

### Latency  
- **Target**: 30% reduction in P99 latency
- **Strategy**: Reduced garbage collection, optimized data structures
- **Measurement**: End-to-end request latency

### Resource Efficiency
- **Target**: 40% reduction in CPU usage
- **Strategy**: Optimized algorithms, better concurrency
- **Measurement**: CPU utilization under load

## Migration Process

### Development Environment

1. **Run both versions side by side**
   ```bash
   # Go version
   go run ./cmd/main.go dev --port 8288
   
   # Rust version  
   cargo run -- dev --port 8289
   ```

2. **Compare functionality**
   - Event ingestion
   - Function execution
   - API responses
   - Performance metrics

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Each Rust crate has comprehensive unit tests
   - Test coverage goal: >90%

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Full end-to-end workflow tests
   - SDK compatibility tests
   - API contract tests

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Load testing with realistic workloads
   - Memory usage profiling
   - Latency measurement

4. **Compatibility Tests**
   - All existing SDKs tested against Rust backend
   - Event format validation
   - Function execution validation

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Shadow Deployment**
   - Run Rust version alongside Go version
   - Mirror traffic to both systems
   - Compare outputs and performance

2. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Start with development environments
   - Move to staging environments
   - Gradual production rollout

3. **Rollback Plan**
   - Keep Go version available for immediate rollback
   - Database schemas remain compatible
   - Quick switching mechanism

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Performance Regression**
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive benchmarking and profiling
   - **Fallback**: Keep Go version deployable

2. **SDK Compatibility Issues**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive compatibility tests
   - **Fallback**: API gateway for translation if needed

3. **Feature Gaps**
   - **Mitigation**: Feature parity checklist and testing
   - **Fallback**: Gradual feature migration

### Operational Risks

1. **Team Learning Curve**
   - **Mitigation**: Rust training and documentation
   - **Support**: Code reviews and pair programming

2. **Deployment Complexity**
   - **Mitigation**: Docker containers and infrastructure as code
   - **Support**: Staging environment testing

3. **Monitoring and Debugging**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive logging and metrics
   - **Support**: Debugging tools and documentation
